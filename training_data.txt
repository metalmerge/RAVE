Dear Mr. Haselton:  

  

Thank you for your letter from the fall.  Please forgive my tardy response.  The surveys we send are used when addressing policy makers in our nation's capital.  The college is grateful that you were willing to take the time to fill it out and to share your additional thoughts.  There is much to be done to win the battle, but if it is to be won, it will be because of diligent citizens like you.   

  

Thank you for your support and friendship.  We wish you every good thing.  

  

Warm regards,
